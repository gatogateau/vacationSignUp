This burger file allows the user to create a new burger, eat the burger, then delete the burger. With each click of a button, the database is updated, added to, or deleted.   

This is done using MySql as the database, and handlebars to render the pages with the database data. 

I have build the ORM in the config folder to build the queries and the controller file to run the get and post routes.   

This functionality of this application would work best with creating and updating a "to do" list.
